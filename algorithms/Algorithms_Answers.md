Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

Exercise 1:
a) O(n)
b) O(log n)
c) O(n^2 * sqrt(n) / 2)
d) O(n log n)
e) O(n^4)
f) O(n)
g) O(n)

Exercise 2:
a) Create two arrays, one to keep track of the minimum value for any given index and one to keep track of the maximum. Then comparing the two should give the index of the highest difference.
b) This would be a binary tree of heights with the topmost node being the middle of the building (n/2) and halving n for each branch, traversing closer to the floor after an egg breaks and higher up if it does not.

Exercise 3:
a) O(n^2) because each item is checked by the list of pivots and then the remaining arrays are sorted
b) O(n log n) because the pivot is behaving in a manner similar to a binary tree it reduces the complexity
